### Opening a PR

Use when PR delivery is part of the authorized task. Local edits and read-only requests do not require a PR.

**Worktree.** Reuse a suitable checkout or isolate concurrent writers in separate worktrees. Preserve unrelated edits and staging; never reset a dirty checkout to simplify delivery. Before committing, merging, or deploying, coordinate exclusive write access, wait for other active writes to stop, then inspect the actual diff and Git status. Pass scope and permissions to every delegate.

**Commits.** Commit liberally. Rebase into small, ordered commits before opening PRs. Each commit is a future PR: landable, ordered to tell the story. Amend when the fix belongs in a just-made commit. New commit when separable. Commit bodies don't restate the subject.

**PRs.** Run `/deslop` over the diff before commit and `/no-comments` before review. Write every PR title, description, and commit body with `/technical-writing` (every layer except Diátaxis, and apply the STE vocabulary rules: one word per action, keep articles, a plain verb over `-ing` where one works), then apply `/unslop`.

**Titles.** Conventional Commits `type(scope): subject`, no trailing period. Type such as `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, or `perf`. Scope is the area, such as `pstack` or `poteto-mode`. Subject is short, imperative, and names a real symbol when one carries the change, for example `fix(pstack): retarget opening-a-pr babysit trigger`.

**Descriptions.** The PR body is a one-minute briefing, not a lab notebook, for a reviewer who has the diff. It says why the change exists, what it leaves out, what it could break, and how you proved it works. Write short, simple sentences with few identifiers, no walls of text. The body becomes the squash commit body, so keep that commit under about 40 lines. Use `##` headings, not bold lead-ins, in this order, and drop a section with nothing to say:

- `## Why`: the problem and approach, 1–3 short sentences. No SHAs, rebase genealogy, or "based on main" preamble.
- `## What changed`: 1–3 short bullets. Name a real symbol or path only when it carries the change. Name both sides of a rename or retarget.
- `## Scope`: always. 1–3 short items on what it covers and what is outside the requested scope. Required unfinished work is not an exclusion that makes the task complete. No symbols, paths, or file-by-file essay.
- `## Tradeoffs`: only rejected alternatives a reviewer would otherwise ask about. Skip when there was no real choice.
- `## Blast Radius`: 1–2 sentences on who or what it touches and why that is safe or risky. If main is red, state the cost of leaving it red.
- `## Verification`: 1–3 bullets, each a real run path and its outcome. Perf: one primary number with its unit, `before → after`, and a link to the arena or swarm directory for the rest. No sample-size methodology, swarm recitals, or metric tables.

After the sections, attach videos or screenshots when they prove a claim. Full SHAs, swarm or arena lane recitals, lever-correction essays, file-by-file checklists, and "CLEAN" verdicts go in a linked artifact, not the body.

**Forge.** Resolve the forge before the first PR operation and keep that choice for create, edit, view, watch, and merge. GitHub CLI (`gh`) is the default. If `command -v origin` succeeds and Origin can resolve the repository, prefer `origin pr ...`. If Origin is absent or cannot resolve the repository, stay on `gh` and record the fallback. Do not require Graphite (`gt`).

**Built-in PR tool.** When the run provides a built-in PR tool, create, edit, retarget, and mark ready through it, never through a forge CLI. A CLI-made PR misses what the tool tracks. Use the resolved forge for everything the tool does not cover, and for every PR operation when the run has no such tool.

**Size and stacks.** Prefer five narrow PRs to one large PR. A stack is a base-branch chain. The root PR targets trunk. Each child branch rebases onto its parent's exact tip and its PR targets the parent branch. As a parent merges, move its child onto trunk per `playbooks/shipping.md` step 4. Without a built-in PR tool, per the resolved forge, create a child with `origin pr create --status open --base <parent-branch>` or `gh pr create --base <parent-branch>`, and retarget one with `origin pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>` or `gh pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>`. Branch from trunk only for independent work. Rebase on trunk before substantial stack work.

**Readiness.** Preserve an explicitly requested draft. Otherwise mark a PR ready when its review prerequisites are met, using the built-in PR tool or resolved forge. Read its actual status back before reporting it. Do not mark incomplete work ready merely to satisfy a workflow template.

**Babysit.** Complete CI and review follow-through already included in the task without a new request. Keep independent build work moving while checks run. A create-PR-only request may end at the verified PR; an authorized merge or shipment continues through Babysit and Shipping.

A subagent completes its assigned delivery stages and returns evidence to the parent. The parent owns any remaining authorized verification and delivery. A delegate handoff does not complete the user's task.
